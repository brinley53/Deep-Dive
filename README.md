Deep Dive is an ocean platformer game where players try to get to the deepest part of the ocean they can while killing enemies (such as lionfish, sharks, and other scary beings), avoiding dangerous platforms, and boosting stats by gathering items. Users can move their character by using the arrow keys to walk, the "F" key to shoot their gun, and the "Space" key to jump. More functionality will be added at a later date.

Deep Dive is made using Unity and C#. The majority of the work done by contributors can be found in the "Assets" folder. Most of the code resides in the "Scripts" sub-folder.
